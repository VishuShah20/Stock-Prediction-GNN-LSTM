STOCK PRICE PREDICTION MODEL:

• Worked on Stock Price Prediction using Graph Neural Networks. <br>
• Conducted an in-depth examination of more than 50 graph neural network research papers used in stock market prediction.<br>
• Used 5 years of OHLC data from NASDAQ and NYSE to generate sequential embeddings using the LSTM model.<br>
• Implemented discretization on the sequential embedding to improve the model performance.<br>
• Used Wiki Relation data and Sector Industry data for relational embedding.<br>
• Average percentage improvement in Return Ratio as compared to baseline model for the selected markets is 18%.<br>
