STOCK PRICE PREDICTION MODEL:

• Worked on Stock Price Prediction using Graph Neural Networks. Conducted an in-depth examination of more than 50 graph neural network research papers used in stock market prediction.
• Used 5 years of OHLC data from NASDAQ and NYSE to generate sequential embeddings using the LSTM model.
• Implemented discretization on the sequential embedding to improve the model performance.
• Used Wiki Relation data and Sector Industry data for relational embedding.
• Average percentage improvement in Return Ratio as compared to baseline model for the selected markets is 18%
